This is collection of 60 pages of basic JavaScript examples inspired by W3Schools. I started this project as a learning activity...just practicing JavaScript, but decided that I wanted to make it more presentable and share it with others. Each page has several JavaScript examples related to the specified subject, and each example has a code snippet. I used Prism.js to style the code. Enjoy! :-)
